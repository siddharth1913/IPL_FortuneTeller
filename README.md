## Key Components:

**CSV Files:** The project relies on CSV files that contain historical IPL match data. These files typically include details such as match date, team names, player statistics, and match outcomes. The data in these CSV files is used for training and testing predictive models.

**Jupyter Notebook (ipynb):** In the Jupyter Notebook, data analysis, preprocessing, and model development take place. 

**Streamlit (app.py):** Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application. The app.py file serves as the front-end of the project, providing a user-friendly interface for users.
